# OpenGLuitar

Playable virtual guitar implemented in OpenGL using C++. Windows-only. All audio files provided by me since I couldn't find any free sample collection.

One core issue is that the application is limited to 1920x1080 monitors because there is no responsiveness built in.

## Libraries
- `glfw.3.4.0`
- `glew-2.2.0.2.2.0.1`
